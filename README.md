# covid-data-analysis
This project analyzes new cases, vaccinations, and death trends for COVID-19 from July 16th to August 12th. 

Data sources: Covid-19 Channel on Github, Our World in Data 
https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data?tab=readme-ov-file 

Methods:
- Data loading + cleaning
- Cleaning missing values, converting types, selecting necessary columns
- Exploratory Data Analysis using matplotlib

Installation:
- Install Python (newest version)
- Instal required packages: pandas, matplotlib, jupyter
- Run the notebook in Jupyter Lab or Notebook

Features:
- Line plot for date, vaccinations, and death trends

Key Findings: 
- As new cases spike, deaths also go up
- Vaccinations have been decreasing after 7/29 significantly.
- Cases spike up and back down to 0 after a couple of days.

Limitations:
- Sudden spikes could be caused by designated reporting days
- Many days are missing reporting data

Why I chose this dataset:
- As COVID seemed to be settling, I wanted to investigate whether vaccinations were still going on and whether new COVID cases still lead to a high volume of deaths like in 2020.
